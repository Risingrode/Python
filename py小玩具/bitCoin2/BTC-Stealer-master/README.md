## About 
**THIS IS A TEMPLATE U MAY DO WHATEVER U WANT WITH IT** `(go to town skids)`

I've seen alot of them around so i decided to create a simple `fake` BTC stealer to make the user think they gotten a random private key for an address

## Features

- Generated address can either start with 1, 3 or bc1
- Able to chance the chance of "finding" an address
- Able to choose thread amount to maximize speed!
- Creates `fake` private key and balance for the address *(able to change balance margin)*
- All `found` address are written to a txt file for easier viewing
- Convert address fake balance to USD depending on real time BTC value


## Install Instructions

1. Download or Gitclone this project
2. Make sure to ofc have `Python 3.9.7` downloaded & added to PATH on install (if you dont know what you're doing please ask someone in my server)
3. Run `Setup-and-run.bat` to installed the needed requirements & run the file after finshed

## Upcoming Updates
