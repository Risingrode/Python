# 16x16.py

16x16Hunter is a simple implementation of a cellular automaton, inspired by the classic game of Life. 
 Each cell has two states, on and off, and the state of each cell is determined by the states of its eight neighboring cells according to a set of rules.
 By setting the initial state of the cells and then letting the automaton run, complex patterns and behavior can emerge.
 
 In this implementation, you canedit the grid by clicking on cells to toggle their state, or by using the options in the Grid Options frame.
 You can start, pause, and step through the automaton using the Play Options frame. 
 You can adjust the speed of the automaton using the Speed frame, and set the initial seed of the random generator using the Random Seed frame. 
 You can also set the rules of the automaton using the Rule frame. 
 The Info frame displays information about the current state of the automaton, including the current tick,
 the number of on and off cells, and the binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representations of the current state.
 
 In addition, you can enter a hexadecimal value in the Enter hex value field and click the Update grid button to set the grid to the corresponding state. 
 This can be useful for exploring specific patterns or behavior.
 
 16x16Hunter was developed by Mizogg as a fun and educational project. The code is available on [GitHub/https://github.com/Mizogg/Tkinter-Power] for anyone to use or modify. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at [https://t.me/CryptoCrackersUK].
