                Creating Bloom File (bloomfilter creation tool CBloom.py)
                
    Put Cbloom.py and your txt file you want to make a bloom from in the same folder then run cmd, 
        navigate to the script folder with CD FOLDERNAME then use command example :

                                python Cbloom.py btc.txt btc.bf
            
                                Cbloom.py can be found in the files folder...
            
                                pip install simplebloomfilter
            
                                pip install bitarray==1.9.2

        THIS IS NOT where the main database file is kept to run Bitcoinhunter.py.

                                    !!!    Database File   !!!
                                        
            This is called puzzle.bf and is in the top main folder with the python program.
        
    This needs to be replaced with your own bloomfilter database using the bloomfilter creation tool CBloom.py
        (Make sure you call your file puzzle.bf or change it's name in the mizlib.py file)


            About Bitcoin : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin

    Bitcoin (Abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred 
    on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through 
    cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. 
    The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

    The currency began use in 2009, when its implementation was released as open-source software.

    Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble,
    by at least eight Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences recipients.

    The word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008. 
    It is a compound of the words bit and coin. No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; 
    some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, 
    for the unit of account.[15] The Wall Street Journal, The Chronicle of Higher Education, 
    and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases.

    The legality of bitcoin varies by region. Nine countries have fully banned bitcoin use, 
    while a further fifteen have implicitly banned it. A few governments have used bitcoin in some capacity. 
    El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, although use by merchants remains low. 
    Ukraine has accepted cryptocurrency donations to fund the resistance to the 2022 Russian invasion. 
    Iran has used bitcoin to bypass sanctions.

    The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin. Currency codes for representing bitcoin are BTC and XBT.
    Its Unicode character is ₿. One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places. 
    Units for smaller amounts of bitcoin are the millibitcoin (mBTC), equal to 1⁄1000 bitcoin, and the satoshi (sat), 
    which is the smallest possible division, and named in homage to bitcoin's creator, 
    representing 1⁄100000000 (one hundred millionth) bitcoin.
     100,000 satoshis are one mBTC.
 
                 Look for Bitcoin with tkinter and python in GUI.

                Based on https://keys.lol
    The seeds used to generate the private keys are derived from the page number. 
    For example, on page 10, the first seed is:
    (10 - 1) * 128 + 0 = 1152
    pages contain 128 keys each, so the last seed on page 10 is:
    (10 - 1) * 128 + 127 = 1279
    This simple formula is repeated for each page, until the maximum seed of 2^256 is reached.

                    Brainwallet Generator
A brainwallet refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorizing a seed phrase.
If the seed is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as being held only in the mind of the owner.
If a brainwallet is forgotten or the person dies or is permanently incapacitated, the Bitcoins are lost forever. 
Using memory techniques allow them to be memorized and recalled easily.

Bitcoin brain wallet generator allows its users to key in random words/symbols
 (i.e. 4,6,8,12, or 24 words long) which is called a passphrase.

Instead of having to deal with that long string of characters, the wallet seed phrase, 
also known as a mnemonic phrase, is made up of 12, 18, or 24 words that the wallet 
originally relies on to initially generate your private key.

Solo Mining in python for BTC Block Reward, Pure luck

This is a solominer random noncences between 0-4294967295 or regular noncences
starting from 0 are checked to see if you could accidently solve the mining problem
 using Python and Get BTC Block Reward, this miner requests job from solockpool and 
start hashing the block header using random noncences, or regular noncences, 
while a new block is detected on network. 
The miner restarts automatically in order to request new job from ckpool, 
if a nonce is found the blockheader data is submited to ckpool automatically.

It is based on Luck giving so much hashrate all around the world, but still possible.

The Script will store in miner.log file those hashes having more than 7 zeros in the beginning. 
Although the current difficulty for getting mining reward is 19 zeros. 
All events is stored in a file called miner.log.

You should replace the existing bitcoin adress in Bitcoinhunter with your own bitcoin address.
